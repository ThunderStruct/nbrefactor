    TODO: this is a hacky way of fixing package-level relative imports. 
    Need to think of a more elegant solution

    We use Markdown headers as both directories (packages) and \
        file names (modules).
    The autonmous, non-command-based method to distinguish between the two \
        is checking
    if the node in the tree has children (leaf node). \
        If it does -> it is a dir, 
    else -> it is a module

    The problem is that a package-level modules 
    (i.e. , ./root/package_a/package_a.py, where package_a 
    contains sub-packages as well) are treated as directories 
    in the module tree rather than files.

    Example notebook:

    cell 0: ## Utilities
    cell 1: *code*
    cell 2: ### File Utils
    cell 3: *code*
    ...

    This translates into 

    -root
    --utilities
    ---utilties.py (cell 1's code)
    ---file_utils.py (cell 3's code)

    In this example, utilities.py is what I refer to as package-level modules. 
    It is treated as the same depth as `cell 0`, 
    hence it is missing an up-level '.' in the relative import. 
    
    This is more challenging than it sounds because we parse the notebook \
        sequentially, 
    so there is no way to figure out if the package at ## Utilities is a \
    package 
    or a module until we reach cell 2 (### File Utils). By which time, 
    cell 1's code was parsed, analyzed, and tracked. 
    
    I hate to think it but... We might need to restructure the parsing logic \
        to do 2 passes, 
    first one figures out packages/modules, second one parses. 
    
    For now, we bite the bullet and add a '.' manually (I won't be able to \
        sleep peacefully)


    Args:
        node (ModuleNode): the current node representing a module or package.
        output_path (str): the path where the Python files should be written.
        is_package_level (bool, optional): whether this node is a \
            package-levle module (i.e. node has sub-packages + code cell(s). \
            This creates a dir AND a `.py` module).
